# Chains supported

In the moment, we support only Bitcoin protocols, where are:

-Liquid Network, a Bitcoin layer-2 solution enabling the fast, confidential settlement and issuance of digital assets, such as stablecoins, security tokens, and other financial instruments, on top of the Bitcoin timechain;



-Sequentia, a Bitcoin sidechain dedicated to asset tokenization and decentralized exchanges.
